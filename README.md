# Django-Chat-Room-and-NLTK

Django Chat Room using Channels 2 and Python NLTK

This is an example app demonstrating how to use (and deploy) [Django Channels](http://channels.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). It's a simple real-time chat app â€” like a very, very light-weight Slack. There are a bunch of rooms, and everyone in the same room can chat, in real-time, with each other (using WebSockets).

You can visit [my deployment of the example online](https://django-chat-room.herokuapp.com)
